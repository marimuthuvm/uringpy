/*
 * uringpy._gilstat: how often the GIL changed owner.
 *
 * CPython counts, in the GIL itself, every acquisition by a thread other than
 * the one that held the lock last (`switch_number` in struct
 * _gil_runtime_state, incremented in take_gil() in Python/ceval_gil.c). That
 * is a hand-off of the lock from one thread to another, counted by the
 * interpreter, not inferred. Since Python 3.12 each interpreter has its own
 * GIL, reached through interp->ceval.gil.
 *
 * The struct is internal, so this module is built against the interpreter's
 * internal headers and must be compiled for the exact version it runs on
 * (which pip does). setup.py marks it optional: if those headers change, the
 * rest of the package still builds and switch_count() is simply unavailable.
